    " - Tuples are immutable, which means once you've created a tuple, you can't change its contents. If you need a modified version, you have to create a new tuple. This immutability makes tuples useful for data that shouldn't change, like coordinates or database records.\n",

    "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Strings are immutable in Python primarily to ensure their reliability and efficiency for various operations, particularly for use as dictionary keys and in memory management.\n",
    " - Reliability and Security\n",
    "Because strings are immutable, their value cannot be changed after creation. This prevents accidental or malicious modification of string data\n",
    " - Memory Efficiency\n",
    "Python can optimize memory usage by allowing multiple variables to point to the same string object if they have the same value. For example, if you create a = \"hello\" and then b = \"hello\", Python's interpreter may point both variables to the same object in memory. This process, called string interning, is only possible because strings are immutable\n",
    " - Hashing\n",
    "Immutability is a prerequisite for a data type to be \"hashable.\" A hashable object has a hash value that never changes during its lifetime. Since dictionaries use a hash table for fast lookups, their keys must be hashable."

    "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Dictionaries offer significant advantages over lists for certain tasks, primarily due to their speed of data retrieval, their ability to store data as key-value pairs, and their flexibility in representing structured data.\n",
    " - Fast Lookups\n",
    "The most notable advantage of a dictionary is its superior performance for searching and retrieving data.  Dictionaries use a hash table internally, which allows for near-instant lookups (on average) regardless of the dictionary's size. You can directly access a value by its unique key, making it much faster than searching through a list.\n",
    " - Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "Unlike lists, which use numerical indices to access elements, dictionaries use descriptive keys. These keys can be strings, numbers, or tuples. This allows you to create more meaningful relationships between data."

    " - Why a tuple is better:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability:\n",
    " - A tuple guarantees that the coordinates will not be accidentally changed. For instance, a function that takes (latitude, longitude) as input cannot alter the original tuple, preventing bugs where a location's data is corrupted. This makes the code more robust.\n",

    "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not ?\n",
    "\n",
    " - No, you can't modify the elements of a tuple. Tuples are immutable, which means their content cannot be changed, added to, or removed after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Tuples are Immutable :\n",
    " - The immutability of tuples is a core design choice in Python for a few key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: \n",
    " - Immutability ensures that the data within a tuple remains constant. This is crucial for situations where you need to guarantee that data won't be accidentally altered, such as when storing coordinates, database records, or configuration settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    " - Python can optimize tuples more aggressively than lists because it doesn't have to account for changes. This can make them slightly faster to create and iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashability:\n",
    " - Because a tuple's contents are fixed, it can be hashed. This means you can use a tuple as a key in a dictionary or as an element in a set, which is not possible with mutable data types like lists."

    " - A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries as its values. This allows you to create a hierarchical or multi-level data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case :\n",
    " - A common use case for a nested dictionary is to represent complex, structured data like a database of users or a JSON object. Each outer key can represent a unique item, and its corresponding value (the inner dictionary) can hold various attributes for that item."

    "\n",
    "How It Achieves O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This high level of performance is due to the dictionary's underlying implementation as a hash table. When you look up a value using its key, Python does the following:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   Key Scenarios for Using Lists :\n",
    "\n",
    " - Maintaining Order\n",
    "If the order of elements is important, a list is the clear choice. Lists maintain the insertion order of their elements\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sequential Data\n",
    "When you need to store a simple sequence of data and access it by a numerical index, lists are the most efficient and natural fit.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Handling Duplicates\n",
    "Lists are the only choice if you need to store duplicate values. Dictionaries require unique keys, so they cannot store duplicate key-value pairs. If your data contains repeated items that are meaningful, a list is the appropriate data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Simple Data\n",

    "20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",

    "\n",
    " - Lists: Retrieval by Index\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections, so you access elements by their position or index, which starts at 0.  For example, to get the first item in a list called my_list, you use my_list[0].\n",

    "Speed: For a list, Python has to search through the elements sequentially. This means that for a list of n items, retrieving an item takes, on average, O(n) time. The larger the list, the longer the retrieval takes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Dictionaries: Retrieval by Key\n",
    "Dictionaries are unordered collections that store data as key-value pairs. You retrieve data by providing the unique key associated with the value you want.  For example, to get the value for the key 'name' in a dictionary called person, you use person['name'].\n",
